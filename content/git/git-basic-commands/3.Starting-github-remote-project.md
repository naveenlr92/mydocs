On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**On branch master** -- we are in the master branch 



Your branch is up to date with **'origin/master'.**  -- this line is new from previous examples

**origin** -- remote repository (remote reference)
**master** -- master branch of remote repository
