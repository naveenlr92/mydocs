## How to read data from text files

 Here's how to extract data from a text file such as reading in a list of servers to test connectivity to them.

 **Target :**

 1. Are reachable from your server
 2. Have name resolution working for them
 3. Are listening on port 22 (for SSH)

 
You also need to report the status to the project team for which you're required to submit in a spreadsheet format. If you're working with dozens of servers and you need to repeat these tests on different days, it is definitely useful to think about an automated way of doing so.

**The input file**

![inputfile](/images/hosts_input.png?width=20pc)

**And this is the CSV file:**

ServerName,IP
m2.example.com,192.168.2.99
xtower.example.com,192.168.2.111
win2k16.example.com,192.168.101.41
control.example.com,192.168.101.200
node1.example.com,192.168.101.201
node2.example.com,192.168.101.202
node3.example.com,192.168.101.203
node4.example.com,192.168.101.204
node5.example.com,192.168.101.205

**The script**

```bash

     #!/usr/bin/bash

     input_file=hosts.csv
     output_file=hosts_tested.csv
 
     echo "ServerName,IP,PING,DNS,SSH" > $output_file 
     cat $input_file | grep -v ServerName | while read line
     do
    host=$(echo $line | cut -f1 -d',')
    ip=$(echo $line | cut -f2 -d',')
 
    ping -c 3 $ip > /dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
       ping_status="OK"
     else
       ping_status="FAIL"
    fi
 
    nslookup $host > /dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
       dns_status="OK"
     else
       dns_status="FAIL"25    fi
 
    nc -z -w3 $ip 22 > /dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ];then
       ssh_status="OK"
   else
      ssh_status="FAIL"
    fi 
   echo "Host = $host IP = $ip" PING_STATUS = $ping_status DNS_STATUS = $dns_status SSH_STATUS = $ssh_status
   echo "$host,$ip,$ping_status,$dns_status,$ssh_status" >> $output_file
    done
```


**The following line items explain the script entries above:**

**Line 6:** Initialize the output file with the header and three new fields to represent the status of reachability via ping and name resolution

**Line 8:** Read input file line by line using a while loop, ignoring the first line (header)

**Lines 10** and 11: Extract the values for host and IP. cut gets the first and second fields using comma as the delimiter

**Lines 13** to 32: Run the ping, nslookup, and nc commands, sending the output to null because we are just interested in the return status from the commands

**Line 34:** Send the output to stdout for the person running the script

**Line 35:** Send the data to the output file with the three new columns (ping_status, dns_status, and ssh_status)

**output file**
